<h1>The Best Movies According to Zachary</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Strangers</h3>
<p>This is a very scary movie; not a gore-flick, but certainly very suspensful. 10/10.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>Personally, this is my favorite film of the trilogy. "Open the Gates!!"</p>
<h3>Queen of the Damned</h3>
<p>Need I say more?</p>
